<h3>Braveheart</h3>
<p>This is my all time favorite movie, nothing compares to this.  
    It's got action, drama, violence, romance, you name it it covers all the bases.</p>

<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>Definately hands down the best sci-fi action movie ever made.</p>

<h3>Top Gun</h3>
<p>Not the remake but the original, this was one of my favorite movies growing up.</p>
